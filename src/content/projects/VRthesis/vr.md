My thesis research during undergrad focused on novel VR spatial interfaces for 3D modeling challenges. My research included a survey of spatial modeling solutions in the field, two prototype interfaces, and a user study of 25 participants from various technical backgrounds and experiences with VR applications. The project was awarded best thesis of the computer science department for the academic year. 

The two 3D modeling interfaces I built focused on the challenge of sculpting terrain for purposes in gaming, flight simulation, and world design. The two interfaces offered similar user interface. However, both interfaces offered unique approaches to how interactions impacted the terrain. 

Interface A was based on a concept of traditional 3D sculpting software such as ZBrush and many others. In this concept, the terrain is considered a malleable surface with no rules for conservation of volume. A user can perform a simple gesture which raises a mountain or depresses a valley.

In contrast, interface B is based on a concept of sandbox/beach play that we may be familiar with from our vacations and childhoods. In this model, terrain volume is conserved, so to form a mountain, a valley must also be created. Material on the terrain has to be pushed and maneuvered from one place to another.

Model 1: Sandbox
----

The first of the two models I developed was made with sandboxes in mind. Given many people have played in sandboxes as children, it crossed my mind that to harness that experience could lead to intuitive user control.  -->
