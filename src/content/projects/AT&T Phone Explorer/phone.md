I was given a brief to create a 3D web experience for AT&T to demonstrate the features of their flagship phones. The brief entailed a vision of sleek motion design, intuitive controls, and feature-specific animations show internal components of the device. 

Tasked with this high level vision, I got to work. I chose ThreeJS as the platform for the experience.The challenge of the prototype was making an experience that was both sleek and phone specific while still staying in the realm of what a designer could configure through a CMS.
