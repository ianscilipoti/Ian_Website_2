Most of my projects begin as a mental picture. I view the technology that goes into creating my images and videos as a tool that serves an artistic vision. That said, node based generative tools such as Blender Geometry Nodes and Touch Designer provide awesome power for creating some really spectacular imagery!

Infinite Growth
-------

This piece is the result of a vision that's been floating around in the back of my mind for a few years now. As humans, we perceive time in one way. I feel that there are lots of amazing stories and corresponding images that hide under alternate perceptions of both time and scale. This is a concept that I'm looking forward to exploring more!

Foreign Ocean
-------

This piece was born from an exploration sphere tracing. The image is almost entirely produced within a GLSL shader rendered in TouchDesigner. The sphere's are procedurally placed and animated using a series of common mathematical equations and curves. As the piece took shape, I began to see it as some kind of abstract reaction taking place at the microscopic scale. Then again, you may see it as something else entirely. That's really the beauty of imagination, isn't it?

Foreign Sunset
-------

This piece was inspired by a similar concept I once saw. The concept really stuck with me since it fluidly combines the abstract 2D colors of the sun and sky with the quasi-realistic 3D reflective water. I find this combination of styles to be very refreshing!

Under the Sea
-------

This abstract piece was inspired by the feeling of looking into the sky in the woods and seeing the trees ever reaching towards the heavens. The motion is inspired by colorful psychedelic mandalas and imagery featured in some live musical acts.
