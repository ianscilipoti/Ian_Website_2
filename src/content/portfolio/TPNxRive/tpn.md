I led the introduction of the animation tool Rive into our creative pipeline. This involved coordination between creative team leads, account specialists, and business leadership of TPN commerce. 

Using Rive, the creative team is empowered to expand their output to include bespoke interactive experiences without relying our their external development partners. This initiative will measurably increase both quality of work output in addition to increasing the scope of work with the largest client of TPN and Omnicom.
