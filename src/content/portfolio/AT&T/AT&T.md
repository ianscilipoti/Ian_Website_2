Since 2022, I've been working as a Creative Technologist at TPN on the AT&T account. This work as led me to wear many hats and be exposed a wide range of projects featured across the nationwide AT&T retail fleet. 

My contributions are focused on rapid prototyping, technology innovation, interfacing between internal teams, clients, and vendors, UX design, and design explorations at the edge of brand guidelines.   

Some of my proudest contributions:
* UX, prototyping, and look-development for a massive 7' tall touchscreen featuring unique ADA and design challenges. 

* Lift and learn physical prototype built using WebSocket enabled synchronization between real-world retail hardware including Brightsign players, a smartTV, and a hand-soldered Arduino circuit for detecting product lift. 

* Research contributions to a major overhaul of an in-store CMS allowing our creative team to drastically increase their output. 

* Rapid prototyping of an Augmented Reality 3D phone experience that convinced our client on a mid 6 figure development spend.
