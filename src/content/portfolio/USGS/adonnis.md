I developed ADONNIS (Automated Downstream Order Naming Numbering Identification System) in a 6 month contract with the USGS. ADONNIS is an internal facing tool designed to automate the task of creating ID numbers for new nation-wide installations of USGS stream gauges. 

The USGS stream gauge ID paradigm is based on the relative position of a potential gauge within its drainage basin. The backend of ADONNIS utilized multiple real-world nationwide datasets to perform stream network traversals to discover nearby stream gauges. To accommodate uncertainties in the datasets, the algorithms I developed contained a robust error checking and validation system capable of requesting human verification for critical uncertainties in addition to flagging provable errors in the data.

The completion of this tool provided a path for the USGS to modernize their internal process re-prioritize personnel and resources dedicated to the manual completion of the automated task.
