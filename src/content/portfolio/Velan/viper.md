During an internship with Velan Studios, I worked on Viper, the Velan in-house game engine. The engine was built to support two in-development titles: MarioKart Live: Home Circuit, and Knockout City. 

My work consisted of writing C code to complete tickets surrounding various aspects of the engine UI and internal mechanics. During my time there, I had the pleasure of collaborating with many fantastic and dedicated engineers, game developers, FX artists, and sound engineers.
