A coworker and I were sponsored by TPN to enter the 2025 Cannes Young Lions competition in partnership with WhyHunger. WhyHunger is a global charity and think tank supplying funding and educational resources to grassroots organizations to solve critical food shortages and promote sustainable farming practices. 

In today's saturated social media climate, new marketing approaches are required to stand out. Our research concluded that potential GenZ donors respond most favorably to honesty and transparency.  

Our digital campaign pitch outlined a strategy based on the production of user-generated short-form vignettes from volunteers and aid recipients to shine light on WhyHunger's impact in transparent terms. Our approach was based on analyzing WhyHunger's existing social channel out, researching non-profit marketing strategies, and reading psychology research papers on our target demographic (GenZ).
