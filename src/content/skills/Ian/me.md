I grew up in a bucolic valley in upstate New York. I spent my time indoors coding and creating digital art and my time outdoors exploring the woods, fields, and meadows of the valley. 

From a young age I was drawn to the medium of computer graphics as a means to capture the beauty and otherworldly chaos of the natural world.
