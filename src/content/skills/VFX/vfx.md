My first explorations of graphics, software dev, etc began around 13 years ago with a fascination for visual effects. I explored creating realistic fires, explosions, auroras, water, etc.

My work gained momentum and soon I was managing a series of popular well reviewed assets on the Unity Asset Store in addition to taking on freelance projects as an FX artist.
