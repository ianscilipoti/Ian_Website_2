My first explorations of graphics, software dev, etc began at the age of 12 with a fascination for visual effects. I explored creating realistic fires, explosions, auroras, water etc. 

My work gained momentum and soon I was able to sell my work on the Unity Asset Store and begin doing freelance FX work for indie games. To this day, my FX packages have sold thousands of copies.
