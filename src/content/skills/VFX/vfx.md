My first explorations of graphics, software dev, etc began at the age of 12 with a fascination with visual effects, shaders, 3D modeling, etc.

My work gained momentum and soon was selling my work on the Asset Store and doing freelance FX work for indie games. To this day, my FX packages have sold thousands of copies.
