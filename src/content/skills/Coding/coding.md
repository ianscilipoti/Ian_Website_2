For the last 10 years, I've written software for a range of personal and professional projects such as pipeline tools, procedural systems, 3D graphics, game logic, CMS based websites, etc. I was awarded Best Computer Science Thesis for my research in virtual reality sculpting. 

I feel very comfortable as a software developer. That said, I prefer to view myself somewhere between an engineer and an artist.
