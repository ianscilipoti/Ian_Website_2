As a child, my music journey began with classical piano. I later branched out to guitar, bass, songwriting, and music production. 

Through a combination of working on music production, generative audio/MIDI, and a cymatics based physical audio visualizer, I've been able to learn a lot about audio, signals, and MIDI.
