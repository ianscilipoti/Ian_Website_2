Since I was a kid, I've been passionate about music. As a kid I learned classical pieces by Liszt and Chopin. In college, I expanded to learn guitar, bass, and music production. 

Fast forward to now, playing in live bands has exposed me to a lot of core principles of audio/video systems, sound engineering, and learning to have fun in front of crowds!
