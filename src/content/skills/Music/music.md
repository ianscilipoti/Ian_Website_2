As a child, my music journey began with classical piano. I later branched out to guitar, bass and music production.My favorite music has groove, a deep sense of humanity, and touch of otherworldliness. 

After learning quite a bit about digital audio production, I eventually came to the conclusion that communicating emotion and complexity through simple singing and guitar/piano is a pursuit nuanced and complex enough to spend years on without worrying about computer tools.
